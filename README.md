# Multifaceted Hierarchical Performance Bug ReportIdentification for Deep Learning Projects

This online appendix is supplementary to the paper entitled "Multifaceted Hierarchical Performance Bug ReportIdentification for Deep Learning Projects".. It contains the raw results, code for the proposed approach, and Colab script to replicate our experiments.

This README file describes the structure of the provided files (Raw data, source code and results). as well as information on the content of this repository.

## How to install

### Google Colaboratory (Python main)

```
!git clone https://github.com/anonymoususr12/MHPurf
```

The easist way to execute the codes for the proposed approach is to download the .ipyb script you need and run it in Google Colaboratory, where you can execute the Python code or R code in your broswer.
